# Bugtracker

Bugtracker is a Node.js app with an Angular 10 frontend. If you would like to learn more about the frontend app, please visit here [repository](https://github.com/vladimirvoth/bugtracker-frontend 'repository').

Bugtracker is a simple-issue tracking app in the tradition of JIRA but much less complicated, for free, and with the goal to suit the needs of small teams in the best possible way. At least in the future because it is yet far off from being finished.
